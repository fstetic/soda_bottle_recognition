# Recognizing soda bottles
This directory contains solutions to two tasks:
1. Comparison between Deep learning with custom model and Transfer 
   learning on a task of classifying images.
1. Generating Segmentation Grid.

Both tasks use the same dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/cola-bottle-identification. \
Masks for segmentation were made using https://supervise.ly/.

`cleaner.py` contains functions for cleaning and checking data.\
Both tasks were solved using Google Colab.


Solution to the first task can be found in `models.ipynb` and also:
