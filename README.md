# Recognizing soda bottles
This directory contains solutions to two tasks:
1. Comparison between Deep learning with custom model and Transfer 
   learning on a task of classifying images.
1. Generating Segmentation Grid.

Both tasks use the same dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/cola-bottle-identification dataset.

`cleaner.py` contains functions for cleaning and checking data.

Both tasks were solved using Google Colab.

Solution to the first task can be found in `models.ipynb` and also:
